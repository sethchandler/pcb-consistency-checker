## Inconsistencies

### 1. Name placeholder: Case Description identifies defendant as 'Mark Davies', while Forensic Report uses placeholder '[Defendant's Name]'.
**Sources:** Case Description, Forensic Report
**Suggested Fix:** **Forensic Report**: Replace '[Defendant's Name]' with 'Mark Davies' to match Case Description because placeholder text should be filled with actual case details.

### 2. Name placeholder: Forensic Report uses placeholder '[Name]' for the Forensic Analyst.
**Sources:** Case Description, Forensic Report
**Suggested Fix:** **Forensic Report**: Replace '[Name]' with the actual name of the Forensic Analyst to provide accurate information.

### 3. Date placeholder: Forensic Report uses placeholder '[Date]' for the Date of Report.
**Sources:** Forensic Report
**Suggested Fix:** **Forensic Report**: Replace '[Date]' with the actual date the report was prepared to provide accurate information.
